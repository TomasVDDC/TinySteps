## Picking a Habit

Choose a habit that’s easy to do—something so simple you can’t fail. If you miss a day, no problem, just don’t miss twice! Instead of aiming for a 10-mile run, start with “lace up your shoes and go outside.” Most times, you’ll end up running plenty anyway.

Start small, stay consistent, and watch your habits grow!
